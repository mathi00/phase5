# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This is a simple Python project that demonstrates how to build a diabetes prediction model using machine learning. It uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database and a Random Forest Classifier as an example. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Project Structure
- `diabetes_prediction.py`: The main Python script containing the code for the diabetes prediction.
- `path/to/your/dataset.csv`: The dataset file (replace with the actual file path).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the code.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required packages installed.
3. Replace `"path/to/your/dataset.csv"` in `diabetes_prediction.py` with the actual file path to your dataset.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the Python script:

   ```shell
   python diabetes_prediction.py
   ```

6. The script will train a model and output the accuracy and a classification report.

## Dataset
- The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains features like age, BMI, glucose levels, etc., and a target variable indicating diabetes status.

## Code Explanation
- The code in `diabetes_prediction.py` loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, and uses a Random Forest Classifier for prediction.
- Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
- The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and a classification report.
